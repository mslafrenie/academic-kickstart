**The Shiner’s Game**
Wow, I am impressed. I truly enjoyed playing this game and got really into it. Nick really put me in the “flow state” I was invested, and I did my best to go through all the options and answer all the riddles honestly.
This game had me google searching and looking at Google Streetview just to find answers and confirm my knowledge. I became invested in the game and luckily, I knew enough about Ottawa to be able to answer all the riddles. It reminded me so much of the online game SPENT. I did successfully make it through the game with all my family members alive.

Nick has really worked hard on this game and smoothed out all the bugs he was struggling with earlier this term. While going through the game I was amazed by the sheer amount of options I had and how the game pushed me to do certain things but wasn’t entirely impossible to survive. It taught me a lot about the hardships of a Shiner lifestyle. 
This game makes me want to make my own game! And given that I have access to Nick’s devlogs and paradata I just might do that in my spare time.

**Reflections on my project:**
This project was inspired by my fascination with doing DH offline or rather with as minimal computing or tech as possible. So, when I was struggling to make the tech work for me, I realized I should take a step back. I needed to revaluate what I wanted to do with this project and ask myself if this was the best way forward. What were my goals? 
*Did I really need tech to achieve them?* 
Staying true to my initial goals and attempting to make this project as fun and as honest as possible was difficult to say the least. The final product is a direct result of my personal challenge to put my money where my mouth is. Criticizing someone else’s decisions and final product is easy but doing so and then proposing a new design is not. I completely understand how difficult the process of making these coins must have been, especially as a former government employee. However, this does not excuse the lack of consultation, foresight and critical engagement that was neglected in the process of the Women’s Right to Vote coin and the Equality coin.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Paradata is so important! Keeping track of what you’re doing and when and only making changes or edits step by step. Also, it’s important to stay calm and try not to become overwhelmed. Failure and error messages are tiring and frustrating but they’re there to help you and they tell you exactly what’s wrong. You just have to listen.

- Ask for help and look at other people’s repositories. Don’t copy their code to yours unless you’ve set your repo to the same parameters as them…this will cause errors. However, you can definitely read their code line for line to figure out where you made a mistake in your repo.

- Celebrate the breakages, errors and failures as much as the successes! To keep coming back and trying to build something regardless of it breaks takes so much resilience and persistence. And this is something I'm applying to my own research outside of this class. When my project website broke I struggled with it and then decided to *just* build a new one with GitHub Pages...I could not have done this before this class.
